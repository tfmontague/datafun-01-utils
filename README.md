# Specification for Project 1 Python Module by Topaz Montague

## Overview
This project introduces Python for professional data analytics. We cover a bit of syntax and Python basics, but there is much more to writing professional Python. We'll cover syntax and basics in these first few projects, but we'll also introduce the key skills used in industry. We use this chance to teach basic Python data types and syntax as a focus for building your first Python module. The module provides an introductory byline for your hypothetical data analytics consulting company, while practicing data types, f-strings, descriptive statistics, and more.

## Deliverable Names
 - GitHub Repository: datafun-01-attr
 - Documentation: README.md
 - Script: mont_analytics_utils.py

## Objective
